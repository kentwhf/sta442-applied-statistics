# Applied Statistics
Project work submitted for the course of Applied Statistics

## Generalized linear models
### Affairs
It contains data collected from 600 married readers of the American magazines *Redbook and Psychology Today* in 1969, who gave information about the frequency they had extramarital sex.The research question of interest concerns the effect of having children on the chances that men and womenhave affairs. It is hypothesized that becoming a mother will make a woman less likely to have extramaritalsex, whereas men are believed to be more likely to have affairs once they become fathers

### Smoking 
Over the course of the next 13 weeks you will be using the 2019 AmericanNational Youth Tobacco Surveyto become an expert in all matters pertaining to the use of cigars, hookahs, and chewing tobacco amongstAmerican school children.

* Smoking of cigars, cigarillos or little cigars is no more common amongst Americans of Europeanancestry than for Hispanic-Americans and African-Americans, once one accounts for the fact thatwhite Americans more likely to live in rural areas and cigar smoking is a rural phenomenon.
* The likelihood of having used a electronic cigarettes on at least one occasion is the same for twoindividuals of the different sexes, provided their age, ethnicity, and other demographic characteristicsare similar.

## Mixed effects models
### School leavers
* What are the most important influences on student performance on math tests? SocialClass, or grade the student is in, or differences between schools or something else?
* More specifically do the data suggest that identifying poorly performing schools andproviding them extra funding would be worthwhile?  Or would it be better to findindividual class rooms which perform poorly and give the teachers in those classesextra training? Or do neither school or classroom have much of an influence on scores,it would be better to identify individual weak students and give them extra attention

### Smoking
Cigarette smoking amongst children is known to be more common for males than females,in rural areas than urban areas, and to vary by age and ethnicity. It is likely that significantvariation amongst the US states exists, and that there is variation from one school to thenext.

* Geographic variation (between states) in the rate of students smoking cigarettes issubstantially greater than variation amongst schools.  As a result, tobacco controlprograms should target the states with the most smoking and not concern themselveswith finding particular schools where smoking is a problem.
* Rural-urban differences are much greater than differences between states.

##  Smoothing with  additive models
### CO2
atmoshperic Carbon Dioxide concentrations from an observatory in Haiwaii, made availableby the Scripps COεProgram [atscrippsco2.ucsd.edu](atscrippsco2.ucsd.edu). I discuss if the CO2 data appears to be impactedby the following events:

* The fall of the Berlin wall in November 1989 years ago, preceding a dramatic fall in industrial productionin the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe;
* The global lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic starting in February 2020, shutting down muchof the global economy.

### Death
Daily mortality counts in Quebec is available from [www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/statistiques/population-demographie/deces-mortalite/nombre-hebdomadaire-deces_an.html](http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/statistiques/population-demographie/deces-mortalite/nombre-hebdomadaire-deces_an.html)

An imaginary government official believes that the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, in March, April and May, primarily affected the elderly. The second wave, which began in September, is caused by irresponsibleyoung people, primarily university undergraduates, acting irresponsibly. Evidence of this can be seen in theweekly mortality counts. Deaths amongst the elderly in the spring were well above the historical averages,whereas the under 50’s had deaths in line with previous years. In the most recent death data, there is anincrease in deaths in the under 50’s whereas the over 70’s have no more deaths than would be expectedpre-covid.

## Two reasonably non-standard problems with Spatial Statistics
### Donald
A short report on the factors that influenced the voters in Wisconsin to vote for Trumpin 2016. Specifically, what are the most important demographic factors which seem to be causing a strongspatial pattern in Trump support? Is Trumpism a primarily urban/rural phenomenon? Or is it rather aracial phenomenon with Trump appealing to White voters? Maybe there’s some other spatial explanatoryvariable which are important but we haven’t looked at? Or is there really very little spatial variation, withTrump voters being evenly distributed throughout Wisconsin?

### England
Someone with some knowledge of COVID-19 says that air pollution puts stress on the lungs andrespiratory tract, so it should be expected that we’d see more covid where air pollution is high.

We would expected to see more COVID-19 where there is high unemployment, as such areas tend tohave high deprivation and low access to health car. 

There are a number of hypotheses as to why areas with many ethnic minorities have more COVID-19,which has been documented in many countries. These include ethnic minorities being more likely tolive in large, multi-generational households, work in high-risk occupations (i.e. the transport industry), and structural racism making access to health care harder.
